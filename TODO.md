# TODOs

## Immediate
* Unit tests:
  - Affine - Vandit
  - Norm - Vandit
* Get point at which tangent from parabola intersects x=lower\_x - Martin
* Optimize tangent locations by back-prop:
  - Rebase on master after merging crossing sigmoid tangent bound - Harish
  - Incorporate new bound for SPU crossing lower constraint - Harish

## Future
* PGD for generating test cases
